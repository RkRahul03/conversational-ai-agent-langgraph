# LangGraph-LangSmith-AI-Agent

## Overview
This project implements a **Conversational AI Agent** powered by **LangGraph, LangChain, and OpenAI GPT models**, enhanced with **LangSmith observability** for tracing, debugging, and performance monitoring.  
The agent is capable of orchestrating multiple tools (web search, calculator, stock API) while supporting **persistent memory, multi-threaded conversations, and real-time response streaming**.

## Features
- **LLM Agent with Tool Integration** → DuckDuckGo search, stock price API, and calculator.  
- **Threaded Memory with SQLite Checkpointing** → Resume multi-session conversations seamlessly.  
- **Streamlit Frontend** → Interactive UI with real-time streaming and tool execution tracking.  
- **LangSmith Integration** → Provides observability, tracing, and monitoring for agent workflows.  

## Tech Stack
- **LangGraph, LangChain, LangSmith**  
- **OpenAI GPT Models**  
- **Streamlit** (frontend UI)  
- **SQLite** (memory persistence)  
- **APIs**: DuckDuckGo, Alpha Vantage
